# Phase 3.3: Programmable Reality - COMPLETE ✅

## Revolutionary Achievement
**Physics and economics as programmable NFTs**

## Contracts (4)

### 1. WorldPhysics.sol
Tokenize laws of physics

**Physics Types:**
- Gravity (anti-gravity, low-gravity, high-gravity)
- Energy (drain rates, generation)
- TimeFlow (slow-mo, fast-forward)
- Causality (cause-effect strength)
- Entropy (chaos level)
- Quantum (randomness)

**Example Modules:**
```
"Low Gravity Module"
- gravityStrength: -50
- energyDrainRate: 50% normal
- Creates floaty gameplay

"High Chaos Module"
- entropyRate: 90%
- quantumFluctuation: 80%
- Unpredictable events
```

### 2. EconomicLaws.sol
Tokenize economic systems

**Economy Types:**
- Post-Scarcity (infinite resources)
- Hyper-Capitalism (dynamic pricing)
- Communal (shared resources)
- Barter (no currency)
- Reputation-Based (trust economy)
- Resource-Based (material wealth)

**Rules:**
- Inflation rate
- Tax rate
- Trade frequency
- Price controls
- Resource decay
- Wealth distribution

### 3. WorldComposer.sol
Mix & match modules into worlds

**Features:**
- Combine physics + economics + psychology
- World as NFT
- Publish and sell worlds
- Modular composition

**Example:**
```
World = "Chaos Realm"
├─ Physics: Anti-Gravity + High Entropy
├─ Economics: Post-Scarcity
└─ Result: Floating, chaotic, abundant world
```

### 4. RealityMarketplace.sol
Trade world modules

**Features:**
- List physics modules for sale
- List economic systems
- License modules (rent without buying)
- Platform fees (2.5%)

## What This Enables

### For Game Developers:
- Buy pre-made physics engines
- License economic systems
- Create exotic game worlds
- Monetize world designs

### For Players:
- Experience unique realities
- Rare physics combinations
- Custom game modes
- Collectible worlds

### For Creators:
- Design physics modules
- Create economic systems
- Sell world templates
- Passive income from licenses

## Real Examples

**"Underwater World"**
```
Physics: 
- Gravity: +200% (heavy)
- Energy: -50% (easy movement)
Economics:
- Barter system
- Resource decay (oxygen)
```

**"Space Station"**
```
Physics:
- Gravity: 0 (zero-g)
- Time: 150% (faster)
Economics:
- Post-scarcity
- Reputation-based trading
```

**"Survival Wasteland"**
```
Physics:
- Entropy: 90% (high chaos)
- Energy: -80% (exhausting)
Economics:
- Resource-based
- High inflation
```

## Status: READY FOR PHASE 3.4 ✅
