- ‚úÖ **Tokenized Time** (entities age, decay, evolve)
- ‚úÖ **Programmable Reality** (physics and economics as NFTs)
- ‚úÖ **Psychological Dynamics** (entities with real emotions)
- ‚úÖ **Risk & Derivatives** (financial primitives for virtual worlds)
- ‚úÖ **Behavioral Identity** (identity based on how you act)
