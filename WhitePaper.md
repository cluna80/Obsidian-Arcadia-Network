# Obsidian Arcadia Network (OAN) White Paper
**Version 2.2 – February 23, 2026**  
*A Complete Digital Civilization Protocol: From Behavioral Intelligence to Programmable Reality*

---

## Abstract
Obsidian Arcadia Network (OAN) is the world's first **complete digital civilization protocol** — combining behavioral AI, Web3 infrastructure, programmable reality, and now **safety & reliability systems**.

OAN tokenizes **intelligence itself** — behaviors, memories, time, emotions, risk, identity, reputation, and now **trust & integrity** — creating living digital worlds where entities evolve, economies emerge, and civilizations develop autonomously and **safely**.

**Current Status (February 23, 2026)**:  
**Production-ready** with **154 compiled smart contracts** across **Layers 1–6**, Python AI engine published on PyPI, and **132 passing tests in Layer 6 alone**.  
**Layer 7 (OAN Integrity Layer)** is next to be implemented.

---

## 1. Introduction & Vision
### The Problem
Current protocols offer static NFTs or simple tokens.  
Current AI systems offer centralized intelligence without ownership.

**Neither enables true, safe digital civilizations.**

### The OAN Solution
A **complete 7-layer protocol** that makes intelligence programmable, tradeable, evolutionary, **and safe**:

1. **Layer 1**: Behavioral AI Engine  
2. **Layer 2**: Web3 Foundation  
3. **Layer 3**: Civilization Protocol  
4. **Layer 4**: Talent & Media Systems  
5. **Layer 5**: Metaverse Sports Arena  
6. **Layer 6**: Advanced Trading & Creator Economy  
7. **Layer 7**: Safety & Reliability (OAN Integrity Layer) ← **Next to be implemented**

**Result**: Entities that think, adapt, feel, age, take risks, build dynasties — **and operate safely under auditable integrity rules**.

---

## 2. The Complete Architecture

### 🧠 Layer 1: Core AI Engine (100% COMPLETE)
**Status**: Published on PyPI as `obsidian-arcadia-network` v1.0.0  
8 modules – Parser, Executor, Behavioral Engine, Entity Manager, Communication Hub, Coordination Hub, Logger, OBSIDIAN DSL.

### ⛓️ Layer 2: Web3 Foundation (100% COMPLETE)
17 contracts covering tokenized entities, identity, DAO governance, and protocol economy.

### 🌑 Layer 3: Civilization Protocol (100% COMPLETE)
24 contracts covering tokenized intelligence, time, programmable reality, psychological dynamics, risk, and behavioral identity.

### 🎭 Layer 4: Talent & Media Systems (100% COMPLETE)
AI Director, AI Actor, SceneNFT, MovieNFT, PropNFT, MediaRights.

### 🏟️ Layer 5: Metaverse Sports Arena (100% COMPLETE)
10+ passing tests in Phase 5.1. Contracts: StadiumNFT, VenueRegistry, SeatingNFT, VenueMarketplace.

### 💱 Layer 6: Advanced Trading & Creator Economy (100% COMPLETE)
**132 passing tests** – fully green!  
UniversalMarketplace, AuctionHouse, BundleMarketplace, OfferSystem, AIToolMarketplace, CreatorProfiles, RoyaltyEngine, ReputationExchange, DerivativesMarket, BondingCurves, FractionalOwnership, RentalMarket, and more.

### 🛡 Layer 7: Safety & Reliability (OAN Integrity Layer) – **Next to be Implemented**
**Status**: Design complete – Implementation starting now

**Core Components**:
- **Secure Execution** – Sandboxed, verifiable agent execution
- **Auditable Agent Behavior** – Full on-chain behavior logging and replay
- **Reputation Enforcement** – Dynamic reputation-weighted access control
- **Stability / Trust Layer** – Circuit breakers, emergency pause, integrity scoring
- **OAN Integrity Layer** – The final guardian layer ensuring the entire civilization operates safely and transparently

**Purpose**: Make autonomous digital civilizations **trustworthy at scale**.

## 4. Token Economics
**$OAN Token**  
- Initial supply: 1,000,000,000  
- Max supply: 10,000,000,000  
- Allocation: 40% Community, 30% DAO Treasury, 20% Team (vested), 10% Ecosystem  
- Utility: Governance, staking, fees, incentives, liquidity, **integrity staking (Layer 7)**

---

## 5. What Makes OAN Revolutionary
OAN is the **first protocol** where:
- Intelligence is a tradeable asset class
- Time is an economic primitive
- Reality is programmable
- Psychology is quantified
- Risk is engineered
- Identity is behavioral
- **Trust & Safety are built into the protocol itself (Layer 7)**
